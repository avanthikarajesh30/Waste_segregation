ABSTRACT


The rapid growth in waste production worldwide has resulted in substantial challenges for waste management, including the proliferation of landfills, pollution, and wasted energy. Manual waste segregation is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, making effective recycling an imperative. We propose an automated system that utilizes object detection technology to improve recycling efficiency. Our real-time waste detection system uses a webcam to categorize waste into three groups: Recyclable, Non-recyclable, and Hazardous. The system, built using the advanced YOLOv8 object detection model, was trained on a custom dataset augmented with Roboflow and utilizes OpenCV for image processing. This system can be implemented in a variety of settings, including homes, parks, and recycling units, to promote eco-friendly practices and efficient waste management in diverse environments.
